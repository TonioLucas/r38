Script to upload the Bitcoin Red Pill e-book and configure the system settings.

### Usage

# Configure privacy page only
python scripts/setup_ebook.py --configure-privacy

# Use custom e-book path
python scripts/setup_ebook.py --upload-ebook --ebook-path="/path/to/your/ebook.pdf"
```

### Prerequisites

2. **E-book file exists**: The script looks for the e-book at the path specified in the PRD by default
3. **Firebase project initialized**: Make sure your Firebase project is set up with Firestore and Storage

### What it does

- **Upload E-book**: Uploads the PDF file to Firebase Storage at the configured path
- **Configure Settings**: Creates the `settings/config` document with default hero text and e-book configuration
- **Configure Privacy Page**: Sets up the privacy page with default content

### Configuration

- **Source Path**: `/Users/toniolucas/vork/r38/Livro Bitcoin Red Pill (3a EdiÃ§Ã£o).pdf`
- **Storage Path**: `ebooks/bitcoin-red-pill-3rd-edition.pdf`
